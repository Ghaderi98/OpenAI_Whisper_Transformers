            "Sam. Just like you did before the accident. Close it. When you're staring into space it's hard to believe you don't remember it woke up in the ambulance. You pieced it all together on the drive. I know you don't remember calling me but I told you even then you look so pretty in a hospital bed I remember you said you were scared and so was I in a standstill on the five. Thought it was unusual. Early traffic. Usually I don't panic. I just wanted to be on time. When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder, I didn't even think of pulling over. I pieced it all together late that night and I know you don't remember going me but I told you even then you look so pretty in a hospital bed I remember you said you were scared and so was I. What if it happened to you on a different day? On a bridge where there wasn't a rail in the way? Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play or the angels crest in the snow or the rain. What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car. What if you were a moat? No one knows where you are. If you change anything, would you not have survived? You're alive. You're alive. You're alive. And I know you don't remember calling me but I told you even then you looked so pretty in your hospital bed I remember you said you were scared.\n"
